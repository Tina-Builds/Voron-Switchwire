These is a mount for the MKS PI-TS35
I had a MKS PI at hand and use it in my Switchwire.
If you use the MKS PI, which is a horrible product, please use the Armbian of https://github.com/redrathnure/armbian-mkspi/tree/custom/mkspi_23.02.0-trunk.0073
The MKS Armbbian is horrible and leaves the displlay nore or less useless. My eMMC to µSD adapter needed to be reworked to fit in a µSD slot, the corners needed to be filed down.
